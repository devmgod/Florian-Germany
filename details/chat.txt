User Avatar
Hi there
3:25 PM
Ok, i think i have completed all setup steps for you.
3:26 PM
So first thing : Add these two entries to your HOSTS file in Windows :
192.168.11.89 dev.das-studio.de
192.168.11.95 coleman-dev-ext.das-studio.de
3:26 PM
First is for the GIT/BitBucket-Server, the second for the DEV-Server with the software instance on it.
3:27 PM
The Application consists of a Framework/Base system and customer specific adaptions.
You can GIT clone the base from this URL (with VPN open and the HOSTS-Entries set) :
http://dev.das-studio.de:7990/scm/dsfw/default.git
Once cloned, select the Branch feature/1.7.5.

You can GIT clone the customer adaptions from :
http://dev.das-studio.de:7990/scm/clm/default.git
After the clone pls select "development" as a branch.
3:29 PM
User Avatar
Okay, will do soon
3:30 PM
User Avatar
ok, i just put the rest of the instructions here in the meantime
3:30 PM
The development instance can be reached at :
https://coleman-dev-ext.das-studio.de

There you can log in with the following credentials :
k-dev@sub-netz.de
kD3v21Hu3

Your account has admin privileges so you're free to look around. Portal is german/englisch which you can switch by clicking the flag in the footer.
3:32 PM
Oh, almost forgot : Your GIT/BitBucket credentials are :
k-dev@Subnetz
KD3vv836%!

4:46 PM
Alright. Let's start with a simple task, shall we?
First, update your git repos, because i pushed some changes in the meantime.
Then :
Navigate to the the WJT ("WebJobTasche") from the Dashboard. Update UI-elements according to the screens i will post here. Whenever possible use/change the global CSS-Vars. (--portal-color-palette-X)

It seems that a Yak.php file is missed in the source, so it's an error to loading the pages.
Can you guide me for Yak, or can provide it me?
1:02 PM

This is the issue...

Have a good day!
1:07 PM
User Avatar
i checked the system and the package IS installed and working.
6:41 PM
i double checked on the server by enabling the WJT ViewCache (which is based on YAC) and it works like normal.
Problem might be your /mnt/PHP-VPN.
As usual for a DEV-Server with this customer i'm working directly on the server as standard and my IDE just uploads every change directly to it.
6:46 PM
i would encourage you to do the same, as you have this server all for yourself. no one else will touch it while development is in progress
6:49 PM
User Avatar
I see
6:55 PM
I will check for it again
6:55 PM
Isn't there any special setup related with Yac I have to additional do?
I had done everything as a guide in the readme.
6:55 PM
Let me retry the options for the source path.
6:56 PM
User Avatar
Oh ... well the readme is kinda outdated/poorly maintained
7:06 PM
This was meant to be a guide for setting up a new Server, you can ignore it fully because the DEV-Server is already prepared.
7:08 PM
Just set your IDE to upload every change directly to the server. There you can use the PHP-Errorlog (/var/log/php/error.log) and the application's own log at (/var/www/coleman/log/log_DATE.log)
7:10 PM
The CSS files are found unter css/ and the template files under template/ (in /var/www/coleman/)

good morning. i'm afraid there was no pull request on the GIT/BitBucket when i checked this morning. To make things easier i've upgraded your repository rights for "coleman" to Read/Write. So you can simply push your changes.
10:25 AM
I'm out of office now for a few hours but will be back later
10:26 AM

I have to push/merge the updated code and test the result on the live site whenever I update each code change currently.
Also, I have no permission to merge the commits.
Looking forward to a better way to check for any code change while I working.

JUL 19, 2021
User Avatar
Good Morning Kyrylo. Right now i can't see any pushed code, aside the test push from 2 days ago.
The workflow here is as follows:
1. Make a change.
2. Let you IDE Auto-Upload it to the server.
3. Test that change.
4. Commit many times, push one time at the end of the day.
5. You can work on your branch of code as long as needed for the work to be done.
6. When feasible i'll merge your branch into develop and create a new one for you when the next part of the work is due.
9:59 AM
If it is OK with you, i would merge my own changes i did in the meantime into develop and create a new branch of it for you to work with.
10:00 AM
I've update the DEV-Server with the changes i did in the meantime. Please check out/ work with the branch feature/wjt_ui_update as of now.

Hi
10:05 PM
I had configured the IDE Auto-Upload and git commit/push in my local.
10:05 PM
So I am working on the UI updates that you asked for.
10:05 PM
I have some questions regarding the coding.
10:05 PM
I found out that CSS but can't find the template files for the UI to update.
10:06 PM
I am now working on the repo of http://dev.das-studio.de:7990/scm/dsfw/default.git for a server accessed by SSL you provided.
10:06 PM
For the work of UI change, should I work on both 2 repos (Framework/Base system, Customer specific adaptions)?
10:07 PM
It observed that Framework/Base system repo is matched with a server's file/directory structure currently, but I can't find really the template needed.
10:11 PM
User Avatar
which template file are you missing?
10:30 PM
i‘ll look into it first thing tomorrow morning
10:31 PM
User Avatar
I'd like to only know how do find a template file needed.
10:32 PM
image.pngimage.png
10:34 PM
For example, I tried to change this UI.
10:34 PM
I found out css needed for that
10:35 PM
But, I am not sure how do find a template needed.
10:36 PM

ok. when the portal is deployed, both, the dsfw and the custom repo (coleman in our case) get copied into one folder. i got my IDE for Coleman repo set up to link/include the dsfw folder. somehow i cant see the fule

Good morning slightly smiling face emoji

Nevertheless i'll post some of the documentation charts here :
9:41 AM
Bildschirmfoto 2021-07-20 um 09.38.08.pngBildschirmfoto 2021-07-20 um 09.38.08.png
9:41 AM
All templates are to be found in the "/template" dir.
- There are templates of the base system/framework which are to be found under "/template/ds/..."
- Shared templates in "/template/shared" and "/template/elements"
- Templates for the customer instance under "/template/CUSTOMER"
9:43 AM
Regarding the WJT, it uses a mix of "ds" and "coleman" templates. Header, Footer and JS-Functions are imported from the "/template/ds/wjt/"
Base template for "coleman" is "/template/coleman/wjt/standard.tpl"
9:45 AM
Most templates are directly connected to a certain View-Class.
The DSFW uses a MVA (Model-View-Adapter) approach which is ,granted, quite uncommon, but i think you will see how that works.
9:46 AM
The system navigates by using simple URL params like : www.ourportal.com/?wjt
9:47 AM
In order for a param to work it must be registered as a "route" in the main config File at /config/Config.php (search in it for "getRegisteredRoutes()" )
When a user navigates to that URL (?wjt) for example. The "\coleman\wjt\adapters\Wjt" is called, which renders its view "/coleman/wjt/views/WjtStandard" (defined in its constructor). This view has then all the data from the assigned Model-Class (also defined in the constructor of the Adapter) and then renders the assigned template-file (assigned in the constructor)
9:52 AM
Important note ist that all "/lib/ds" and "/template/ds" files SHOULD be used "as is" and only be modified if REALLY needed (thus keeping the base system interchangeable, as possible)
9:53 AM
The "WJT" is to be seen only as an "App" inside the base portal system. It also has its own config under /lib/coleman/wjt/config/ApplicationConfig
9:54 AM
User Avatar
OK, Thank you so much. I understand. Let me have a look the template again.
9:56 AM
User Avatar
Alright, let me drop you some additional info while i'm at it.
JS calls to the API/Backend are organized by js wrappers and a specific request/response scheme outline here (sorry again for german doc) :

User Avatar

9:59 AM
I understood the frontend logic that uses 2 different templates on the website we building.
11:45 AM
I'd like to ask one question regarding to push of github.
11:46 AM
Currently, 2 different templates(ds and coleman) are basically configured in the server.
11:46 AM
So I have to update needed on the source and can check it in live.
However, the ds and coleman templates are stored separately in the different repositories in GitHub.
11:46 AM
Thus, should I push the updates I worked for the source on the server into 2 repositories separately?
11:46 AM
Repo 1 - Framework/Base system (for ds)
Repo 2 - Customer specific adaptions (for coleman)
11:48 AM
For example, if I changed a "ds" template, I have to push into repo1, otherwise, if I changed a "coleman" template, I have to push into repo2. If I changed for both of 2, I have to twice push into 2 repositories separately.
11:52 AM
Is right this operation?
11:54 AM
User Avatar
Yes, you got it right. But the DSFW should only be altered/updated if REALLY needed. And, as of now you don't have the proper access right to push to it.
12:14 PM
Do you currently have something to push to DSFW?
12:14 PM
Another thing just to clarify : When you say "GitHub" you don't mean the web service that uses Git but the Git-System itself? I'm just saying because none of this code must go to GitHub.

no. the red bars are job names. each job belongs to a category ( „campinggaz“ in this example. but ignore those jobs, they are relic from a former version of this portal

its a bit difficult to see because the category „coleman“ also has to subcategories called „gas“ and „camping“

Personally i'd work with a thick visible border on the subcategories (in the collapsed view). And changing their label from something like "camping" into a abbreviation like "CMP". In fact there is already a defined "shortcut" column for each category (but only in my version as of now, gotta merge before it appears in yours)
9:30 AM
How about this : You try the border thing i suggested and integrate the possibility to display a second category label when the column is collapsed. That second label you can leave empty or fill it with something like "test", and i'll handle the assignment to the new category shortcut in the next version.?
9:33 AM
That second label is only needed for subcategories
9:33 AM
User Avatar
Updated, check it
9:34 AM
User Avatar
The updateSelectedTopCategories() (which is, by the way not 100% correctly labeled because it is updating ALL selected categoriy ids) is not firing on any click on the subcategories.
9:38 AM
User Avatar
I dont understand
9:39 AM
It works for the subcategory ids, right?

A selection of a single subcategory is not communicated to the backend, because the even doesn't fire. So the whole thing does not work as needed. The only thing i can do is select a top category and that's it. again : it must be possible to select a single subcategory only
9:43 AM
User Avatar
Understand
9:46 AM
Will do
9:46 AM
User Avatar
and, as i just came to see : "Select/Deselect" all is collapsing all top categories when selected, that must not happen. select/deselect all must not have any impact on the view besides selecting/deselecting all/none.

When i select a subcategory there is still no update to the backend ... only when clicking a top category
10:18 AM
select/deselect all does work properly though
10:19 AM
User Avatar
A selection of a single subcategory is not communicated to the backend,
10:23 AM
What update should be there when select a subcategory?
10:24 AM
User Avatar
For instance : When all categories are unselected (grey) and you click just one subcategory, only the id of the selected subcategory must be transmitted.
10:26 AM
If X categories are selected and you select another sub-/category , all the selected (blue marked) categories must be transmitted.
10:27 AM
Goal is to keep a consistent representation of all selected categories in the session.
10:27 AM
User Avatar
I understand, but I tried it already, work nothing with sub category ids
10:28 AM
Just updated
10:29 AM
User Avatar
so you can't attach the event/function call to subcategories??
10:30 AM
User Avatar
Do you want me to create new functions for restoring sub cateogry selections?
10:32 AM
it needs to edit the function of `ds` folder
10:33 AM
User Avatar
It should be simple as firiing the updateSessionSelectedCategories() function, you made a screenshot of, this morning, when selecting a subcategory?

cCategory is, most likely a typo/false.
This code uses the "hungarian notation" with unique prefixes for typeless variables.
"c" is not a regular Prefix. Most likely will be "oCategory" , in "o" for Object
10:42 AM

it is reflected value of `bSelected`?

cCategory is sub category
10:44 AM
a sub category*
10:44 AM
will change to sCategory
10:45 AM
User Avatar
aCategories (array of category objects) is fed by the view to this template. and in this template a foreach loop iterates over all objects as oCategory.
10:46 AM
sCategory would be wrong because that would indicate a string content, not an object
10:46 AM
if you can't fix this right now, let it be for the moment. i gotta check out of my hotel in 15mins . if you can, push your code so i can review it more detailed. at the end of this day i'll release the milestone when all things are settled
10:47 AM

OK, firstly create it

sCategory is the name of the sub category.

good morning kyrylo.
9:29 AM
sry, i could not review your code yesterday.
9:29 AM
We still have several issues with the current task:
1. Subcategory selection still does not result in a update call to the backend like it is happening for the top categories.
2. You did not use the branch i assigned you to work with. You committed into "development" and i told you to commit into "feature/multilevel_category_tile_selector".
3. Minor issues but still unnecessary --> You committed part of your IDE internals (.vscode/sftp.json) into the repository.
9:32 AM
And i can't see that you changed anything besides the CSS?

Concerning 2. --> It is essential that you work with the GIT branch i select/assign you. For this current issue, in order to avoid confusion, i'm accepting that you work with the "development" branch until this issue is finished. For every other task that comes up in the future please use the assigned branch ONLY.

Hi Florian,

All issues are fixed.
12:41 AM
If I work on `feature/multilevel_category_tile_selector` branch, how to test the result?
12:43 AM
User Avatar
Good Morning Kyrylo.Will check results soon. Concerning your question the workflow explained :
1. I prepare a new branch for you.
2. I update your server with that branch's code.
3. You checkout that branch and transfer changed files directly to the server as usual.
4. When you're finished i check the result and the next task starts at 1. again
9:39 AM
Alright, i checked your results. There is still that severe problem that the selection in the UI is NOT consistent with what is communicated to the backend. In fact, that hasn't got any better since yesterday.

Ok, the UI element itself is now working according to spec when it comes to selection logic and transmission of selected ids to the backend.
I'll take it from here, merge the code with my branch and find out why the subcategory's bSelected is not properly set (it should, but obviously is not doing so) .

I checked your work and most of the items are now done.
11:01 AM
Unfortunately the filter criteria dropdown no longer works since your update (see attached screen of a previous working version)
11:02 AM
the problem here is that data-toggle=dropdown must be set and if you add/change that to data-toggle=tooltip , the dropdown disappears.
11:05 AM
if you can't come up with a quick solution to this, it's ok for me , as i don't want to keep this task open any longer.
11:06 AM
Concerning the proposed 150€ , i personally fail to see how this task was 50% more work than the previous ones, justifying that price hike.

Ok, here's the plan :
1. I provide you with documentation to the proprietary PHP-Framework we're using. Unfortunately this documentation is rather incomplete and outdated but it should provide rough means of orientation.
2. When you ingested the doc, i'll provide you with a fresh testing sandbox server and create a basic programming task for you.
3. When i get the feeling that you're up to speed, we'll start the real work on my current project.

Of course i'll compensate you for your efforts on 1.+ 2.

As the our previous project is still active, i guess (but don't know for sure) , that we can simply add more milestones to it without having to create a new one.

What do you say?

Hey Kyrylo. Just a quick heads-up from me. I need more time to prepare the documents and the task as there are some key doc missing atm. Expect 1-2days delay. Sorry , i'll get back to you as fast as i can.

Hey Kyrylo. Please find attached a PDF that explains some basic stuff about the proprietary PHP-Framework the customer uses. I'm afraid some of it is in german , but, together with the code you have access to. Sholud help you to get a basis understanding of how things are done with this software. Please feel free to ask questions. A lot of it is not self-explaining i guess, and the documentation is currently quite bad.

When you ingested this doc, we can move on to the first real task. That'll be a extension of the project you alread worked on "Coleman". I've already updated your dev server instance with the latest version and database. I'll try to give you the specific briefing tomorrow.

Hi
11:49 AM
How are you?
11:49 AM
I did review carefully the document.
11:49 AM
Most contents were written in German, so I couldn't read it, however I understood basically DSFW's system logic via the flow diagrams and some contents.
11:49 AM
As I understood...
The DSFW is based on the MVA model.
M-model (data model)
V-view(user interface-ds_view, template engine)
A-adapter(control-access, action...)
11:50 AM
I also understood 2 ways how to access a special entity within the ecosystem.
11:50 AM
I hope we are able to ahead a new brief soon.
11:51 AM
Thanks in advance!

Hi

Sry, for the german documenation . This happened because the original file disappeared and i had only screenshots from that.
11:54 AM
The most "learning" will come to you when you start with the first programming task.
I'm creating a briefing for this as we speak , but have to wait for feedback from my customer for some things, yet unclear/unspecified.
11:56 AM
I will update the DSFW-Documentation regularly from now on. Shedding more light on implementation details and call/response scheme.

5:26 PM
API: statistics_GetWorkloadData( )
params: job type
response: Array[{date: [ 5 items ]},...], maxLength=14
5:27 PM
One question
When calculating the B2O deadline how is it to get local holidays?
5:27 PM
I can complete it for 3 days.
5:30 PM
User Avatar
Don't worry about that. The B2O will be calculated BUT the customer can change it. Thats true for the "new job" form as well as the "deadlines" block in the job detail view.
So, when you have the job, you can read the B2O from the attached "deadlines" block (db: wjt_block_deadlines, referenced from wjt_job) .
5:32 PM

Ok, understand
5:33 PM
I'd like to estimate 300 for this.

I didn't work for 2 days as bad health.
I am fine now and hard working, so the work is going well.
I will finish the work today.
One question
Please check for db entry for B2O and D2V of each job.
6:30 PM

6:32 PM
I have got a joblist included that Blockdeadlines to calculate an API array. It seems the data in DB value was broken there.

Hi. What do you mean with "Please check for db entry for B2O and D2V of each job."

The D2V date is not part of the calculation i briefed !?
8:16 PM
Here's a code snippet to get the job's deadlines data. :

however
8:22 PM

Odd thing here is the "B2O"-Date ist called the "Artwork Deadline" and "D2V" "Deliver Deadline"
8:22 PM
That's because they changed the wording of "B20" like 4 times ...
8:22 PM
User Avatar
On th app running what's the reason that all B2Os are displayed as "1970-01-01..."
8:25 PM

Also I got the Blockdeadlines of each job like above code

Good Morning. I've just updated the DB of your "Coleman" instance to the latest from LIVE.
Hint : You can create any number of jobs by yourself to test your code if you like.
All mails the system will create are currently rerouted to a debugging address and the portal logging system is set to "Debug" for your convienience. (I guess you alread discovered the logging mechanism and the logfiles in /WEBROOT/log/
12:21 PM
I also encourage you to use unit testing for your development.
Unit-Tests are placed unter /WEBROOT/test/ and can be run by e.G. :
sudo -u www-data phpunit coleman/wjt/APITest.php --bootstrap=_bootstrap.php

Hi Kyrylo. I've checked your work. Good job on adapting the general code style and generally for getting your head around the existing code.
Unfortunately you did not provide a unit test and when i added that (in a most simple) way the code crashes.
This is most likely because of your reliance on a existing session+session job filter to retrieve all the jobs.
I fixed that part for you (now retrieving ALL "Active" jobs that are not flagged as "archive") but now more problems occur.
Please fix so that the unit test (Run as root from the "test" dir) --> sudo -u www-data phpunit coleman/wjt/APITest.php --bootstrap=_bootstrap.php

Outputs the array on cmdline.
11:59 AM
This is the change i made :

yes. that "calendar page" is the erp tool. one can click on each day and enter a simple value in a popup. Code exists already but has to be adapted
6:29 PM

Ok, understand
6:30 PM
For first requirement, should I implement newly it or can I update from original code?
6:32 PM
I understood that I can update from the original implementation code for both of 2 requirements.
6:33 PM
User Avatar
Take the existing erp widget view class, throw out everything you don't need (because we have the API function you implemented in Phase1)
6:34 PM
exactly
6:34 PM
The widget shows data from both. The function you already implemented and the data the user can enter in the ERP tool

I'm sry, but that won't work out. The code is mostly present and i fail to see why it would take you 10 Hours+ (40$/hour is your profile rate) for integration.
6:50 PM
200.- for the whole task is reasonable i think.
6:51 PM
User Avatar
Well, I didn't check the original code yet.
I thought that I can't expect correctly now if which issues will happen to integrate the original code with the project(add a widget and a page).
I will follow your quote but if 250 its would be better, I think.

That is, the PPS class called there isn't exist really in that path(coleman/wjt/adapters/).

The PPS is from the portal i copied some of the classes from.PPS class is not really needed . In this portal there is only one PPS and thats „Das Studio“ . The widget view will take most of its data from the function you implemented in the previous task

widget should display data from the function plus the data entered in the erp tool. If its doing that it is fine for me

Regarding AdminERP calendar, I have some questions
11:17 PM
I updated to add navigation called "Employee Resource Planning" into the menu and to display a calendar by it.
As see, currently, the calendar displays as one page fully without a nav menu and data is missed in a Select element on top right in above of the calendar. That's a wrong display.
11:17 PM
As I reviewed the code, seems some files were missed for AdminERP module.

coleman/system/adapters/
ds/system/adapters/
11:17 PM
At least, some files related to Admin module should be in these paths, I think
11:18 PM
Next. Data of Select element mentioned is dependent on PPS.

Hi Kyrylo
12:19 PM
Last question first. You don't have to assign the aPPS template var because there are no PPS in the coleman system besides DAS STUDIO. To work this out i suggest the select element to be hidden an having a preselected option with the value of 1
12:20 PM
As for the "full page" problem : You have to use another trigger "MenuItemActionJSCall" (using the real classname instead of the name of the route) in the desk menu model.

Hi,
4:28 PM
Calendar is displayed correctly
4:28 PM
One question
4:28 PM
On the calendar
Original code calls an API called "adminErp_SetAvailableWorkersForDayAndPPS" to save availableWorkers.
As I reviewed the whole code, that API doesn't exist currently.
If so, should I create that API on this briefing?
4:28 PM

4:29 PM
User Avatar
hang on ... the function is really missing in coleman. checking now
4:52 PM
Alright, pls update your GIT. I added the missing function and already modified it to work with coleman. I also added the PPS model/adapter (needed for the unit test to complete)

That API works

Hi
11:52 AM
I've checked your work and have to issues/questions.
1. When the user enters a value of Zero in the ERPAdmin the ERP entry should be deleted (instead of showing 0 Workers) .
2. All columns in the ERPWidget show exactly the same data (except workers per day). Are you sure this is correct?
11:54 AM
User Avatar
Sure
5:58 PM
for 1
That displays O workers.
Ok, I will update it
7:08 PM
for 2
I am sure the data
7:08 PM
I just updated for 1 point and pushed it.
Please check for it again

Hi
1:48 PM
The fix you applied did work. BUT , as i updated the DB with the latest jobdata from the LIVE-DB, the ERP-Widget displays complete nonsense data.
Look at the first row for example. How can "utilization hours" be negative? And if its negative how can -9.24 of 6.96 be 42.97 percent? Please check soon. I was trying to present the work to the customer this afternoon and i can't go through with it like this.

After you scraped the surface of the portal software, running "Coleman". Now it is time to go into the deep.
1:11 PM
The more you get to know this software, the more work i can give you.
For this time, i tried to explain it as far as possible, giving you hints and specifics. This is also a lot of preparation work for me but i'm confident that this will work out fine.

Take a look at the file i just provided and ask me any questions anytime, no matter when.

Again : The goal is/was NOT to change any font on exisiting layout elements.
The goal ist to REPLACE the external INCLUDES. Are you familiar with goole fonts? You can either load Google-Fonts via URL OR you can upload a local version of the font file and use this instead.
And i NEED all of the used google fonts (Rubik, ...) to be loaded from the local server, NOT google.
This is why i HIGHLIGHTED the outgoing font requests in the PICTURE i provided in YouTrack.

simple : Open the website in your browser, open dev-tools, check if any google fonts requests are still fired to google instead of the webserver itself

Who is "Lionel" ? Please no funny stuff like switching comm channels (we already established that via Skype) or requesting payment via PayPal or such.

Let's focus solely on this task. In the meantime i have spend almost the same amount of time communicating and briefing that i would have spent fixing this by myself.

So please : Fix it, report the fix to me, get your money and let us be done with this task.

10:44 AM
What did you do to break the whole site?
10:44 AM
User Avatar
seems like you uploaded inside wrong folder
10:47 AM
in that folder there should be also a file called enqueues~0.php
10:47 AM
that is the correct folder
10:47 AM

it's just this file is missing. nothing wrong
10:48 AM
here is what happened .. I uploaded this file using plugin and clicked on to keep backup of original file. So it renamed original file to enqueues~0.php and uploaded my file.

Then I changed something in file and uploaded it again to replace my old file, but this time it gives uploading error, so it removed old file (mine one) and latest file wasn't uploaded
